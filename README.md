# CS GUIDE website
The system we built, "CS GUIDE", is an educational platform dedicated to computer science students at Imam Mohammed bin Saud Islamic University.
This platform aims to facilitate the learning process and improve students' experience by providing comprehensive and attractive educational resources covering various subjects in computer science.
The system allows students to browse content easily by subject of each course, with subjects classified into major categories such as basic courses, general courses, and elective courses. Materials are also organized logically and systematically within each category to facilitate access and meet students' needs.
In addition, the system provides a range of useful university services that students can need, helping them achieve their educational goals better and more effectively.



To set up the CS GUIDE website, certain steps are required to equip the working environment and use specific software techniques and languages.

## Here is an overview of the preparation process:
#### Planning and Requirements Gathering:
- We defined the goals and requirements of the CS GUIDE website, including providing learning resources for computer science courses at Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University and offering university services.

#### Use of techniques:
- We utilized appropriate technologies to implement the website's functionalities, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development, and Node.js with Express for back-end development.
- MongoDB was chosen as the database management system to efficiently store website data.

#### Development Environment Setup:
- Node.js and MongoDB were installed on our machines.
- Visual Studio Code text editor was installed.
- A new project was set up and configured using npm (Node Package Manager).

#### Front-end Development:
- We designed and developed the user interface using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

#### Back-end Development:
- The server-side was set up using Node.js with the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Routing, middleware, and business logic were implemented to manage website functionalities, such as user authentication and database interactions.

#### Database Configuration:
- A database schema was designed to store and manage website data related to learning resources, university services, and other relevant information efficiently, including admin name and password.
- MongoDB was integrated on the back-end to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as needed.

#### Testing and Debugging:
- All functionalities were tested to ensure proper operation.
- Errors were fixed, and necessary modifications were made.

By following these steps and leveraging the mentioned technologies and programming languages, we successfully created the CS GUIDE website on the web, providing valuable educational resources and university services to its users.
